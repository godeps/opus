[![Test](https://github.com/godeps/opus/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/godeps/opus/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is a fork of `gopkg.in/hraban/opus.v2`, modified to use a WASM build of libopus with wazero, removing the CGo dependency. The modified version is hosted at [github.com/godeps/opus](https://github.com/godeps/opus).

## Go wrapper for Opus

This package provides a Go wrapper for the Opus audio codec, utilizing a WebAssembly (WASM) build of libopus executed via the wazero runtime. This approach eliminates the CGo dependency, making the library self-contained.

The C libraries and docs are hosted at https://opus-codec.org/. This package
just handles the wrapping in Go, and is unaffiliated with xiph.org.

Features:

- ✅ encode and decode raw PCM data to raw Opus data
- ✅ useful when you control the recording device, _and_ the playback
- ✅ decode .opus and .ogg files into raw audio data ("PCM")
- ✅ fully self-contained (no external libopus dependency needed)
- ✅ works easily on Linux, Mac, Windows, and Docker (thanks to WASM)
- ✅ thread-safe WASM module pool with automatic reuse across goroutines
- ❌ does not _create_ .opus or .ogg files (but feel free to send a PR)
- ❌ does not work with .wav files (you need a separate .wav library for that)
- ✅ self-contained binary (WASM build of libopus included)
- ✅ cross-compiling is straightforward (CGo removed)

Good use cases:

- 👍 you are writing a music player app in Go, and you want to play back .opus files
- 👍 you record raw wav in a web app or mobile app, you encode it as Opus on the client, you send the opus to a remote webserver written in Go, and you want to decode it back to raw audio data on that server

## Details

This wrapper interacts with a WASM build of the xiph.org opus library for:

* encoders
* decoders
* files & streams

### Concurrency / pooling

The library keeps a pool of WebAssembly module instances behind the scenes. Each encoder/decoder acquires its own instance when created, so you can run multiple goroutines in parallel without additional locking. When an encoder/decoder (or other helper) is released, the underlying instance is returned to the pool for reuse.

### Import

```go
import "github.com/godeps/opus"
```

### Encoding

To encode raw audio to the Opus format, create an encoder first:

```go
const sampleRate = 48000
const channels = 1 // mono; 2 for stereo

enc, err := opus.NewEncoder(sampleRate, channels, opus.AppVoIP)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
```

Then pass it some raw PCM data to encode.

Make sure that the raw PCM data you want to encode has a legal Opus frame size.
This means it must be exactly 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 ms long. The number of
bytes this corresponds to depends on the sample rate (see the [libopus
documentation](https://www.opus-codec.org/docs/opus_api-1.1.3/group__opus__encoder.html)).

```go
var pcm []int16 = ... // obtain your raw PCM data somewhere
const bufferSize = 1000 // choose any buffer size you like. 1k is plenty.

// Check the frame size. You don't need to do this if you trust your input.
frameSize := len(pcm) // must be interleaved if stereo
frameSizeMs := float32(frameSize) / channels * 1000 / sampleRate
switch frameSizeMs {
case 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60:
    // Good.
default:
    return fmt.Errorf("Illegal frame size: %d bytes (%f ms)", frameSize, frameSizeMs)
}

data := make([]byte, bufferSize)
n, err := enc.Encode(pcm, data)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
data = data[:n] // only the first N bytes are opus data. Just like io.Reader.
```

Note that you must choose a target buffer size, and this buffer size will affect
the encoding process:

> Size of the allocated memory for the output payload. This may be used to
> impose an upper limit on the instant bitrate, but should not be used as the
> only bitrate control. Use `OPUS_SET_BITRATE` to control the bitrate.

### Decoding

To decode opus data to raw PCM format, first create a decoder:

```go
dec, err := opus.NewDecoder(sampleRate, channels)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
```

Now pass it the opus bytes, and a buffer to store the PCM sound in:

```go
var frameSizeMs float32 = ...  // if you don't know, go with 60 ms.
frameSize := channels * frameSizeMs * sampleRate / 1000
pcm := make([]int16, int(frameSize))
n, err := dec.Decode(data, pcm)
if err != nil {
    ...
}

// To get all samples (interleaved if multiple channels):
pcm = pcm[:n*channels] // only necessary if you didn't know the right frame size

// or access sample per sample, directly:
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    ch1 := pcm[i*channels+0]
    // For stereo output: copy ch1 into ch2 in mono mode, or deinterleave stereo
    ch2 := pcm[(i*channels)+(channels-1)]
}
```

To handle packet loss from an unreliable network, see the
[DecodePLC](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/godeps/opus#Decoder.DecodePLC) and
[DecodeFEC](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/godeps/opus#Decoder.DecodeFEC)
options.

### Streams (and Files)

To decode a .opus file (or .ogg with Opus data), or to decode a "Opus stream"
(which is a Ogg stream with Opus data), use the `Stream` interface. It wraps an
io.Reader providing the raw stream bytes and returns the decoded Opus data.

A crude example for reading from a .opus file:

```go
f, err := os.Open(fname)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
s, err := opus.NewStream(f)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
defer s.Close()
pcmbuf := make([]int16, 16384)
for {
    n, err = s.Read(pcmbuf)
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    } else if err != nil {
        ...
    }
    pcm := pcmbuf[:n*channels]

    // send pcm to audio device here, or write to a .wav file

}
```

See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/godeps/opus#Stream for further info.

### "My .ogg/.opus file doesn't play!" or "How do I play Opus in VLC / mplayer / ...?"

Note: this package only does _encoding_ of your audio, to _raw opus data_. You can't just dump those all in one big file and play it back. You need extra info. First of all, you need to know how big each individual block is. Remember: opus data is a stream of encoded separate blocks, not one big stream of bytes. Second, you need meta-data: how many channels? What's the sampling rate? Frame size? Etc.

Look closely at the decoding sample code (not stream), above: we're passing all that meta-data in, hard-coded. If you just put all your encoded bytes in one big file and gave that to a media player, it wouldn't know what to do with it. It wouldn't even know that it's Opus data. It would just look like `/dev/random`.

What you need is a [container format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format_(computing)).

Compare it to video:

* Encodings: MPEG[1234], VP9, H26[45], AV1
* Container formats: .mkv, .avi, .mov, .ogv

For Opus audio, the most common container format is OGG, aka .ogg or .opus. You'll know OGG from OGG/Vorbis: that's [Vorbis](https://xiph.org/vorbis/) encoded audio in an OGG container. So for Opus, you'd call it OGG/Opus. But technically you could stick opus data in any container format that supports it, including e.g. Matroska (.mka for audio, you probably know it from .mkv for video).

Note: libopus, the C library that this wraps, technically comes with libopusfile, which can help with the creation of OGG/Opus streams from raw audio data. I just never needed it myself, so I haven't added the necessary code for it. If you find yourself adding it: send me a PR and we'll get it merged.

This libopus wrapper _does_ come with code for _decoding_ an OGG/Opus stream. Just not for writing one.

## Build & Installation

No external C library dependencies are required! This package embeds a WebAssembly (WASM) build of libopus and uses the [wazero](https://wazero.io/) runtime to execute it. This means:

- No need to install `libopus-dev`, `libopusfile-dev`, or `pkg-config`.
- `go build` works out of the box.
- Cross-compilation is simplified as there's no CGo.
- Docker images don't need special `apt-get` or `brew` installs for Opus.

You can simply build your Go application:
```sh
go build
```
The sections below regarding `libopusfile` build tags, Docker configurations for C libraries, and linking `libopus`/`libopusfile` are no longer applicable due to the self-contained WASM approach.
